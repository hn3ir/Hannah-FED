DOM Crash Course Part 1 notes
- Object Oriented Representation = each node has its own properties and methods that we can change/add/remove etc

- Elements (head, body tags) = children of the root element.
  - those elements have children (body, a tags,)
    -those elements have text nodes ("my header")
  -attributes are connected to elements (ie href onto 'a' tag)
