        Mayer was born on October 16, 1977 in Bridgeport, Connecticut[1] to Richard (a high-school principal) and
        Margaret Mayer (a middle-school English teacher).<span>He grew up in nearby Fairfield, the middle child between
        older brother Carl and younger brother Ben.</span>  His father is Jewish, and Mayer has said that he relates to
        Judaism. As a middle school student, Mayer became close friends with future tennis star James Blake, and
        they often played Nintendo together after school. He attended the Center for Global Studies at Brien McMahon
        High School in Norwalk for his junior year (then known as the Center for Japanese Studies Abroad, a magnet
        program for learning Japanese).
